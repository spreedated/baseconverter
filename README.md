# Base Converter
---
This is just another base converter software, based on ***C*** code written for the ***AMIGA***.
Pretty straight forward ***WinForms*** application, with a simple GUI, that allows you to convert numbers from one base to another.

The `convert.cpp` is adjusted to use ***C++*** with `extern` keyword, so it can be used in ***C#*** directly.
